          ## There are three types or readiness probes:
          ##
          ## More generally, a liveness probe is used to determine whether the application is "healthy" and should
          ## recieve traffic. Whereas, a readiness probe is used to determine whether the application has finished
          ## its boot and is now online
          ##
          ## - HTTP Liveness
          ## - TCP Liveness
          ## - Exec liveness
          ##
          ## Below are examples of each healthcheck type with descriptions of when to use them
          ##
          # livenessProbe:
            ##
            # tcpSocket:
            ##
            ## The "tcpSocket" health check is useful for when an application exposes a port, but there are no utilities
            ## to determine whether that application is healthy over that port. So, the fact the application is listening
            ## on that port is taken as a "proxy" health measure.
            ##
            ##
              # port: "__CONTAINER_PORT_NAME__"
              ## Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are initiated.
              ## See http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pod-states#container-probes
              ##
              # initialDelaySeconds: 5
              ##
              ## Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Minimum value is 1
              ##
              # timeoutSeconds: 1
              ##
              ## Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after having succeeded.
              ## Minimum value is 1.
              ##
              # failureThreshold: 3
              ##
            ##
            # exec:
            ##
            ## The "exec" healthcheck is useful when there is a bundled program to determine whether the application is
            ## healthy (such as "mysqladmin ping"). It is also useful if the application does not open a network port
            ## for communicating with other applications, but still represents its state on disk somehow.
            ##
              ## The command executed by exec is expected to return "0" to indicate healthy, and any nonzero status code
              ## to indicate unhealthy.
              # command:
                # - cat
                # - /tmp/healthy
              ##
              # initialDelaySeconds: 5
              ##
              ## Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Minimum value is 1
              ##

              ## Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after having succeeded.
              ## Minimum value is 1.

              # failureThreshold: 3
            ##
            # httpGet
            #
            ## As the name implies, the "httpGet" health check places a HTTP GET request to an endpoint defined by the
            ## the application. It seems to be the superior method of health checking where the application supports
            ## HTTP, as the semantics are known and usually reliable.
            ##
              ## The path that the HTTP GET request will be made to. Any code > 200 and < 400 is OK. Any other code is
              ## not OK
              ##
              # path: /healthz
              ##
              ## If the application exposes the health checking port on a non standard port, indicate here. Otherwise,
              ## use a named application port defined above.
              ##
              # port: "__CONTAINER_PORT_NAME__"
              ##
              ## Additional HTTP headers can be supplied to the HTTP health check to modify the behaviour, such as to
              ## supply a HOST header.
              ##
              # httpHeaders:
                # - name: "X-Custom-Header"
                #   value: "Awesome"
              ##
              # initialDelaySeconds: 5
              ##
              ## Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Minimum value is 1
              ##
              # timeoutSeconds: 1
              ##
              ## Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after having succeeded.
              ## Minimum value is 1.
              ##
              # failureThreshold: 3
          ## The Readiness probe follows exactly the same syntax as the liveness probe, and the examples above can
          ## be reused.
